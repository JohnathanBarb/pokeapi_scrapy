# PokeAPI Scrapy

[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the PokÃ©mon main game series.

The pokeapi_scrapy is a CRUD API that provides the data we scrapped from PokeAPI.  
Basically, we use [FastAPI Framework](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) for make the API and [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) for scrapy the PokeAPI.

The FastAPI provides a documentation about the API created using it, it's located on /docs endpoint.  
> Example:
>> If you run using the commands bellow, it is going to be on <http://localhost:8080/docs>.
